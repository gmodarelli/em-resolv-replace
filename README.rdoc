= em-resolv-replace

EventMachine-aware DNS lookup for Ruby.

Ruby's stock DNS resolution, by default, blocks the entire Ruby VM from processing while
the lookup is happening, because it calls out to the native libc resolver code.  A slow 
DNS server can cause your entire Ruby process to grind to a halt.  Ruby comes with a pure
Ruby replacement that is not loaded by default:

    require 'resolv'
    require 'resolv-replace'

'resolv' is the pure Ruby DNS resolver.  'resolv-replace' monkeypatches the various Ruby
Socket objects to use resolv.  This gem monkeypatches the monkeypatch so that the Socket
classes will use an EventMachine-aware resolver, em-dns-resolver.

== Requirements

em-resolv-replace requires Ruby 1.9.

== Installation

    gem install em-resolv-replace

== Usage

Just require em-resolv-replace when initializing your application:

    require 'em-resolv-replace'

The code will use the EM-aware resolver if EventMachine is running.

== Credits

em-dns-resolver.rb is taken from the em-dns project, with a connection bugfix applied by myself,
and was written by Aman Gupta and Stephan Maka.
